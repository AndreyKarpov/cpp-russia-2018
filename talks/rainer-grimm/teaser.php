            <p>What have classical template metaprograming, the new type-traits library, and the constexpr functions in common? All three will be executed at compile time. Therefore, they combine high performance with enriched functionality. High performance, because computations can be moved from runtime time to compile time. Enriched functionality, because computation at compile time can modify the resulting C++ source code. But how does the whole magic work? I will give you in my presentation a view under the hood. Therefore, you can better understand und use programming at compile time.</p>
