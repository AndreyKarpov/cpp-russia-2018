                Going functional

        <div class="talk-description">
            <p>Functional programming is often said to be necessary in multi-threaded
               environments, but that is only one part of the story. Avoiding
               mutation helps avoid explicit synchronization of concurrent processes,
               but it can also be helpful in other circumstances.</p>

            <p>In this talk, we are going to cover the basic ideas of functional
               programming and functional software design. We will focus mainly on
               how to design stateful software that never mutates any data, and how
               to do it optimally.</p>
