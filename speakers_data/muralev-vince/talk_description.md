The talk will look at limitations of compilers when creating fast code and how
to make more effective use of both the underlying micro-architecture of modern
CPU's  and how algorithmic optimizations may have surprising effects on the
generated code. We shall discuss several specific CPU architecture features and
their pros and cons in relation to creating fast C++ code. We then expand with
several algorithmic techniques, not usually well-documented, for making faster,
compiler friendly, C++.

 

Note that we shall not discuss caching and related issues here as they are well
documented elsewhere.
