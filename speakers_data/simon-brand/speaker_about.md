I am a GPGPU toolchain developer with particular interest in C++. I have an unhealthy love of template metaprogramming and the dark corners of the language and can usually be found on Stack Overflow, the C++ Slack channel, or the C++ Edinburgh Meetups which I co-organise.

I welcome all discussion of language lawyering, template hacks, beer, whisky, experimental cinema and Carly Rae Jepsen.
