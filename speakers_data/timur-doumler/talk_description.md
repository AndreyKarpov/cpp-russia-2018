C++ offers great performance and many powerful features like the standard library, a rich type system, and compile-time programming. However, it often ends up being hard to read. High-level languages like C++ are usually not written to communicate with compilers. Theyâ€™re usually written to communicate with people. In fact, many developers spend more time reading and understanding other people's code than writing their own.

This talk focuses on how to optimise C++ code for being easily readable by average human developers, ideally being close to plain English. I will revisit best practices on naming, comments, and locality from a modern C++ perspective. Readability also means writing less code and avoiding repetitions and unnecessary noise. I will present practical use cases of modern C++ features that are especially effective to achieve this. I will finish the talk with an overview of new C++17 features aiming at more readable code, such as fold expressions, constexpr-if, and structured bindings.
