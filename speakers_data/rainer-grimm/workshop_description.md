Prerequisite

    C++
    Fundamentals of multithreading

Agenda

This workshop about multithreading with modern C++ will be about the high end interface of C++ and the low level details. At the high end, we will cover the known topics like Threads, Shared variables, Save initialization of variables, Thread local data, condition variables and tasks.

That includes the theory, but also a lot of hands on experience with that challenging topic. At the low level details, we will look at the details of the memory model. You will get an idea, what the memory model is all about, how you can reason about your lock-free programs and of course, how you can verify, that your program is data race free.
