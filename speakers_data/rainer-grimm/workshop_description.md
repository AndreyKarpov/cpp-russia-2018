Embedded programming is one of the key domains of modern C++. 
Because C++ empowers you to talk directly to the hardware and offers you this kinds of abstractions you need build complex systems. 
With C++11 C++ gets a lot of mighty features for the embedded programming. 
C++ has features like the move semantic for cheap move operations, constexpr functions for calculations at compile time, or new containers like std::array, which combines the best from the C array and the std::vector.

I will show you in the workshop the benefits of modern C++ in the embedded programming. Therefore, I will concentrate on the requirements of embedded programming and give the answers in modern C++. 
The requirements are:

* Safety critical systems
* Reduced resources
* Long lifetime
* Many cores

After the workshop you will understand the well-known sentence from Bjarne Stroustrup about c++11 in embedded programming: 
"... make C++ even better for embedded system programming..".
