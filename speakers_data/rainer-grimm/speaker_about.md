Rainer Grimm is a longtime software developer and instructor. He invests some of his spare time in writing articles about the programming languages C++, Python and Haskell for the Linux-Magazine. 

He works as a software architect and team lead for Metrax, building defibrillators for the private citizen and the clinical environment. So he brings together his training as a male nurse and as a mathematican. 

His old and new passion is the programming language C++. He published the two books «C++11 für Programmierer» and «C++ kurz & gut».
